            <h2>Key Concepts in Algorithms</h2>

        <section>
            <h3>1) What is the significance of time complexity in algorithms?</h3>
            <p>
                Time complexity provides a theoretical measure of the efficiency of an algorithm, helping to predict its performance as input size grows. It allows developers to choose the most optimal algorithm for solving a problem in terms of execution time.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>2) How does divide-and-conquer work in problem-solving?</h3>
            <p>
                Divide-and-conquer splits a problem into smaller subproblems, solves them recursively, and combines their solutions. This technique is used in algorithms like merge sort and quick sort to improve efficiency and scalability.

            <h3>3) Why are graph algorithms essential in computer science?</h3>
            <p>
                Graph algorithms solve complex connectivity and optimization problems in networks. From finding the shortest path to constructing efficient road networks, they play a pivotal role in both theoretical and practical applications.

            <h3>4) What is the role of dynamic programming in optimization?</h3>
            <p>
                Dynamic programming stores intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations, ensuring efficiency in solving overlapping subproblem-based tasks. Examples include finding the longest common subsequence or solving the knapsack problem.

            <h3>5) What differentiates greedy algorithms from dynamic programming?</h3>
            <p>
                Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices in the hope of finding a global solution, while dynamic programming considers all possibilities and stores intermediate results for optimal outcomes. Examples include Kruskal’s MST (greedy) and Floyd-Warshall for shortest paths (dynamic programming).

            <h3>7) What is the importance of edge relaxation in graph algorithms?</h3>
            <p>
                Edge relaxation is used in algorithms like Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford to iteratively improve the shortest path estimation. This technique ensures optimal routing and efficient communication in networks.
