        <h2>🛠 Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Engineering Exploration:Urea Dispenser</strong>:The Urea Dispenser an creative and interactive project designed to know more about tecnnology,dispensing the urea to the the field using automation and some other method.
                Interactive Response System:

                Dispenser eqippied with the sensor to dectet the amount of urea,light ,
                Real-time reaction like dispensing urea,

                
                Programmable Behavior:

                Users can modify the dispenser using some dispensing boxes or a simple coding interface.
                Preloaded  actions and customizable routines.
                Smart Connectivity:

                Integration with Bluetooth ,sensors and some dc motors.
                Compatibility with remotes and laptop.
                li>
            <li><strong>Design Thinking and Social Innovation:Lackof Education In The Orphange</strong>:Eduaction is Fundamental Right,Every child need good quality of education but students in the orphange were deprived from these right,they didn't know about their carrier,addressing these issue made them plan properly about carrier and their goals,These enchase their confidence and make them to work hard,we also given some ideas about cracking scolorship exam which make financially stable and helps in their accademics jouney .
