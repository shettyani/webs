    <h1>Problems in Nature: Iteration, Recursion, and Backtracking</h1>
    <p><strong>Iteration:</strong> Iteration refers to the repetition or step-by-step processes observed in nature, such as cell division, the cycle of seasons, or the rise and fall of waves.</p>
    <p><strong>Recursion:</strong> Recursion involves a process where an answer leads to another, requiring backtracking to reach the main answer, such as in tree branching or DNA structure.</p>
    <p><strong>Backtracking:</strong> Backtracking explores all potential solutions and revises when needed to find the optimal solution, seen in scenarios like bees collecting nectar or the traveling salesman problem.</p>

    <h1>Space and Time Efficiency</h1>
    <p><strong>Space Efficiency:</strong> Refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm, represented by space complexity.</p>
    <p><strong>Time Efficiency:</strong> Measures how fast an algorithm executes, represented by time complexity.</p>
    <p><strong>Why They Are Important:</strong> Efficient programs are critical for handling large inputs, saving memory, reducing delays, and minimizing costs.</p>
    <p><strong>Orders of Growth:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Constant (O(1)): No change in time with input size</li>
        <li>Logarithmic (O(log n)): Time grows logarithmically, e.g., binary search</li>
        <li>Linear (O(n)): Time grows proportionally, e.g., traversing an array</li>
        <li>Linearithmic (O(n log n)): Time grows slower than quadratic, e.g., heap sort</li>
        <li>Quadratic (O(n²)): Time grows quadratically, e.g., bubble sort</li>
        <li>Cubic (O(n³)): Time grows cubically, e.g., triple nested loops</li>
        <li>Exponential (O(2ⁿ)): Time doubles with input size, e.g., n-Queens problem</li>
        <li>Factorial (O(n!)): Time grows factorial, e.g., generating permutations</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Hierarchical Data and Tree Data Structures</h1>
    <p><strong>Tree:</strong> A tree where nodes have multiple children but lack efficiency.</p>
    <p><strong>Binary Search Tree (BST):</strong> A tree where each node’s left child is smaller and the right child is larger, used for search, insertion, and deletion.</p>
    <p><strong>AVL Tree:</strong> A self-balancing BST with a height difference of at most 1 for each node’s subtrees.</p>
    <p><strong>2-3 Tree:</strong> A balanced tree where each node has either two or three children, reducing complexity compared to AVL trees.</p>
    <p><strong>Red-Black Tree:</strong> A self-balancing BST that uses red or black nodes, with fewer rotations compared to AVL trees.</p>
    <p><strong>Heap:</strong> A complete binary tree used for priority queues, where the parent is greater (max-heap) or smaller (min-heap) than its children.</p>
    <p><strong>Trie:</strong> A tree where keys are stored in edges, useful for dictionaries and autocomplete.</p>

    <h1>Array Query Algorithms</h1>
    <p><strong>Segment Trees:</strong> Efficient for handling high-frequency updates and queries.</p>
    <p><strong>Fenwick Trees:</strong> Suitable for fast range queries with less memory usage.</p>
    <p><strong>Lookup Tables:</strong> Best for small data sets where fast access is required.</p>

    <h1>Tree vs Graph and Their Traversals</h1>
    <p><strong>Tree:</strong> A connected, cycle-free graph with one root node and one parent per node.</p>
